## The FormAssembly OAuth2 API

### Introduction:

FormAssembly exposes an [OAuth2](http://oauth.net/2/) authenticated API.  Using this API, you can write applications which will interact with the accounts of users who grant your application permission.  OAuth interactions can be complicated, so if you're not familiar with OAuth2, please read a document such as [this one from Google](https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2) explaining how OAuth2 works in detail.

The key point of OAuth2 is that it allows a 'user' of FormAssembly, let's call them Adam, to authorize you (a 'client') to take actions in FormAssembly as if you were Adam.  As an example, you could write an application which when authorized by Adam, could download and display a list of all of Adam's forms in FormAssembly along with their associated number of responses, drop-out rate, etc.  This data could then be used by you to generate custom metrics for Adam, or stored for later use, etc.

### Behavior Outline:

1. Redirect the user to the authorization url:
https://app.formassembly.com/oauth/login?type=web&client_id=CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=RETURN_URL&response_type=code where:
    + CLIENT_ID is the unique client id generated by FormAssembly for your client application
    + RETURN_URL is the url your user ('Adam') will be returned to when they complete the authorization step on FormAssembly.  FormAssembly will append a parameter 'code' to this url when returning the user to the url. So that a redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com (note the value is URL-encoded) will result in the user ('Adam') being taken to: https://www.google.com?code=XXXXXXXXXX on authorizing FormAssembly.

2. Catch the users' authorization code:
    * When the user ('Adam') returns to your site after step 1, the parameter 'code' will be in the url.

3. Use that code to generate a token request on your server, by POSTing the following parameters to the url:
    
    HTTP POST:

    + "grant_type=authorization_code" – how you're authentication we're trying
    + "type=web_server" – what style of authentication steps we're using
    + "client_id=CLIENT_ID" – your unique client application id issued by FormAssembly
    + "client_secret=CLIENT_SECRET" – your unique client application secret password issued by FormAssembly
    + "redirect_uri=RETURN_URL" – the same RETURN_URL used in step 1
    + "code=CODE" – the code parameter appended to the RETURN_URL from step 1.

   (Note: Do *not* direct the user to this URL.  Make the request server-side using your preferred server-side HTTP library, such as cURL or HTTPLib.)

The response to this POST will be a JSON array like so:
 
    {"access_token":"XXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
      "expires_in":XXXXX,
      "scope":XXXX,
      "refresh_token":"XXXXXXXXXXXX"}

Store the access_token value for later use.


With the access token, you can make requests to any of FormAssembly's endpoints and receive data back as if the user ( 'Adam' ) was making the request.  For example:

https://app.formassembly.com/forms/index.json?access_token=ACCESS_TOKEN

(ACCESS_TOKEN is the token received in step 3.)

will result in a JSON formatted list of the forms in the user ('Adam')'s account:

    {"Forms":[{
    "Form":{
    "id":"XXXX", "version_id":"XXXX", "name":"XXXXXXXX",
    "category":"XXXX", "subcategory":"XXXX", "is_template":"XXXX",
    "display_status":"XXXX", "moderation_status":"XXXX", "expired":"XXXX",
    "use_ssl":"XXXX", "user_id":"XXXX",
    "created":"XXXXXXXX", "modified":"XXXXXXXX",
    "Aggregate_metadata":{
    "id":"XXXX", "response_count":"XXXX", "submitted_count":"XXXX",
    "saved_count":"XXXX", "unread_count":"XXXX", "dropout_rate":"XXXX",
    "average_completion_time":"XXXX", "is_uptodate":"XXXX"
        }}
    }]}

For an explanation of each field, please see [Object Reference](#object-reference).

Several output formats are accepted, see [End Points](#end-points) for more details.


### End Points:

#### Formats:

FormAssembly supports returning data in two main formats:

  + [json](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Json): a lightweight data exchange format supported by newer languages.  Directly parsable by Javascript.
  + [xml](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML):  an industry standard data exchange format, parsable by almost all languages.
And some end-points support additional including:
  + [plist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plist): used to provide Apple consumable data for Objective-C applications
  + [csv](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values): used as a standard record data exchange format.
  + [zip](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZIP_(file_format\)): a binary data container format.

#### Forms: [Returned Fields Reference]

##### Index:
+ https://app.formassembly.com/api_v1/forms/index.json
+ https://app.formassembly.com/api_v1/forms/index.xml
